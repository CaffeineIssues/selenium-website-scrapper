# selenium-website-scrapper
Quick example on how to scrap a table from a .net website with multiple frames using selenium.

i used it to automatize a process where an employee would go to an old .net website and copy a full 24 columns table with around 5000 entries from it then paste on a spreadsheet and use the data to generate kpis. Now the scrapper generates a csv that is used as source for a javascript which generate the kpis.

requires python 3.0+
